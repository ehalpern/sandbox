A light scala framework for building reactive REST services in a modular,
testable fashion using Typesafe Config, Guice, Akka and Spray.

  - Uses (Guice) dependency injection to simplify and modularize code (and tame implicits)
  - Injects (Typesafe) configuration properties to avoid boilerplate configuration code
  - Establishes clear, concise patterns for implementing and testing reactive, end-to-end REST services using Spray
  - Combines these techniques to provide a simple, complete, scalable structure for building REST server applications
